At start, the People's Socialist Republic of Albania is led by First Secretary Enver Hoxha, leader of the Hypersocialist vanguard Party of Labour of Albania. Under his iron fist, Albania has isolated itself from the Soviet Sphere due to being Krushchevite revisionists, and is vaguely in the sphere of the People's Republic of China. Albania also leads the "International Conference of Communist Parties for the Preservation of the International Communist Movement" (Intercom), a Hypersocialist faction within the Chinese sphere. The offical ideology of Albania, the Party and the Conference is Proletarianism, a Hypersocialist form of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, and is the largest form of Hypersocialism in the world and they consider themselves the vanguard of international Proletarianism.

During the Iranian Civil War, Albania can infiltrate the Labour Party of Iran and empower the Hypersocialist wing, which allows them to officially establish Intercom as its own movement, seperate from the Chinese sphere. As Hoxha ages, he can even proclaim the World Socialist Republic and transform the Party of Labour of Albania into the Party of Proletarian Internationalism.
