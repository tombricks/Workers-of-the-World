-------------------------------- Gameplay --------------------------------
In the general Cold War against the People's Republic of China, the situation of the USSR is perhaps more impactful on the world as a whole than any other nation. For this reason, I have decided to rid the idea of a Stalinist Civil War. Instead, the player will focus on internal politics and external diplomacy, the two of which are undoubtedly intertwined. 

There aren't outright factions per-say, but rather two general lines. More conservative-aligned members prefer a hard-line Communist Party, including reversing reforms. They also prefer tougher control over the Soviet sphere and expanding the military-industrial might to stick it to China. They are not afraid to use force to get what they want. More reformist-aligned members prefer a softer Communist Party and prefer to increase reforms, loosen state control (to a limited extent) and praises the socialist brotherhood and friendship between nations rather than forcing them with military might. They still, however, counter China.

The first main path, until the XXVIth Congress where the internal factions solidify, is the creation of a true successor to the Comintern. This is done via a revitalisation of the InterDep (International Department of the CC of the CPSU). This sees the creation of the International Communist League. Conservative influence can see the adoption of International Democratic Centralism (freedom of discussion, unity of action), which is meant to be democratic centralism applied directly to the world communist movement. In reality, it means that the USSR can curbstomp any opposing communist party.
	
	"In the light of the international conflict over the leadership of the International Communist Movement, the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has taken the initiative to being the process of refounding Lenin's Third International. These efforts have allowed me to now declare the First World Congress of the International Communist League."
