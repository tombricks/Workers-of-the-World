# German Democratic People's Republic
## List of Organisations
- ### <ins>Union of German Communists</ins>
#### Bund Deutscher Kommunisten - BDK
The Union of German Communists is the ruling party of Germany and follows a Reformist Socialist "Eurocommunist" ideology. It is led by the mainstream faction which currently holds the most power. Many wish to establish a new homegrown European order free from the Bolshevik dominance of Russisa.
- ### <ins>Union of German Communists (Spartacists)</ins>
#### Bund Deutscher Kommunisten (Spartakisten) - BDK(S)
The Spartacist Faction of the party follows a Marxist-Leninist ideology which seeks to reverse the reforms made by the mainstream and return Germany to a solidly Marxist-Leninist nation.
- ### <ins>Anti-Fascist Action</ins>
#### Antifaschistische Aktion - Antifa
Anti-Fascist Action is an illegal underground militant group that follows a Marxist-Leninist ideology. While not formally associated with the Spartacist faction of the BDK, many members secretly align with each other and there is a loose consensus of co-operation between the two groups.
- ### <ins>Union of German Communists (Internationalists)</ins>
#### Bund Deutscher Kommunisten (Internationalisten) - BDK(I)
The Internationalsit faction of the party follows a New Marxist ideology which aligns with the People's Republic of China and seeks to increase co-operation with them and to split ties with the Soviet Union and United Nations.
- ### <ins>Free German Youth</ins>
#### Freie Deutsche Jugend - FDJ
The Free German Youth is the official youth movement of the Republic, but the state has over time began to diminish the influence they hold for the leadership and the rest of the organisation has been growing a stronger New Marxist influence. They are often considered "a State within a State" and the only reason for their continued resistance is the fear of armed revolt.  The BDK(I) are the most prominent supporters within the political establishment for the continued existance of the youth movement, and they work together to spread the influence of New Marxism and pro-China ideals.
- ### <ins>National Committee for a Free Germany</ins>
#### Nationalkomitee Freies Deutschland - NKFD
The Committee was originally an anti-Nazi organisation that worked with the Soviet forces as they occupied Germany and set up a new regime. Years after the Committee was disestablished, it was reformed by a number of Party functionaries as a Hypersocialist and German Nationalist faction of the party and eventually split off into their own opposition group.
- ### <ins>Greater Germanic Reich Party</ins>
#### Gro√ügermanische Reichspartei - GGRP
The Greater Germanic Reich Party was created as an underground continuation of the Nazi Party.

"Nationalism is not the antithesis of Socialism. Rather, a Nationalistic Socialism is the wider application of class conflict to the conflict of nations. Therefore, it is not in opposition to the ideas but rather the logical further continuation of said ideas." - Some German Bloke
