Following WWII, the Soviets don't withdraw from Azerbaijan and instead incorporate it into the Azerbaijani SSR. In 1949, the Tudeh Party is cracked down by the Iranian government which starts a revolt and, with Soviet aid, the Iranian government is overthrown and replaced with the Republic of Iran under Tudeh leadership. Heavily Stalinist, the party splinters following Destalinisation with the regime moderating itself to remain close to the USSR. This leads to the founding of the Labour Party of Iran which is a hardcore Anti-Revisionist anti-Tudeh party, secretly backed by the CHI.
