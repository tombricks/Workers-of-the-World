Following the political commotion within Moscow, an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly was called to meet in New York. The first act of the assembly was from the American Deligate to the United Nations, nominating themselves to replace the Soviet Union as Chair of the Assembly. An ad hoc motion, nothing similar has ever been discussed and it caused a scene within the meeting hall, with the Soviet Delegate storming off. The motion passed despite the abstaination and opposition from a number of influential countries. It was unknown even to the American Delegate whether this move to take the Chairship was valid, but it did not matter to them and his allied delegates. The Soviet Delegate has refused to communicate with the now USSA-led intergovernmental organisation and the USSR has stopped all diplomatic content with the afforementioned American country.
