 LOADING_TIP_0: "The modern revisionists and reactionaries call us Stalinists, thinking that they insult us and, in fact, that is what they have in mind. But, on the contrary, they glorify us with this epithet; it is an honour for us to be Stalinists for while we maintain such a stand the enemy cannot and will never force us to our knees.\n- Enver Hoxha"
