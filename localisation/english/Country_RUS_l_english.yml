 RUS_Yevgeny_Stalin_desc: "„I was just speaking to Comrade Stalin“ is not a phrase one would have expected to hear in the 1980s, decades after the Man of Steel, General Secretary Josef Stalin passed away, but that is how history would have it. Yevgeny Stalin, grandson of the infamous Bolshevik revolutionary, has long upheld the legacy of his grandfather as one of a mighty leader who defeated his enemies and led the Soviet Union to triumph and has become a figurehead leader of the §RStalinists§! within the Union. His years of vocal opposition to reformism and allegations of his grandfather have paid off, with him becoming the §Y„Head of the Union, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and Supreme Commander-in-chief“§!, which is to say, he has become the official head of state of the USSR."
